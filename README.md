# Human-Centric-Phishing-System

Phishing remains one of the most relevant cyber security threats. These social engineering attacks often bypass organizational security measures, resulting in severe consequences. Existing machine learning (ML) models face challenges due to imbalanced datasets (i.e., a limited number of phishing examples) and vulnerability to adversarial attacks specifically designed by criminals to evade detection filters. The project followed the structured CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology used by several data scientists, which consists of: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, and Evaluation. My approach advocates that instead of duplicating the minority class (phishing email content). I diversified the dataset by integrating four datasets, lowering the significant difference in the quantity of data instances between phishing and non-phishing email content. My approach led to enhancing the models' performances, achieving a higher true positive detection rate when tested against unseen phishing and adversarial emails compared to models trained on the original, imbalanced data.
